This is a basic Todo list built in my spare time.  It's a Chrome extension and (for now) it is an unpacked Chrome extension.  Follow these instructions to install:

Visit chrome://extensions (via omnibox or menu -> Tools -> Extensions).
Enable Developer mode by ticking the checkbox in the upper-right corner.
Click on the "Load unpacked extension..." button.
Select the directory containing your unpacked extension.

The JK2DO app will now appear in your extensions list.  Click "Launch" to launch it.   Note: Unpacked extensions also generate a security warning when Chrome first boots up.
